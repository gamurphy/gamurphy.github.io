              <p>Hello! I'm Grace, a dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at Boston University, set to graduate in 2025. Throughout my academic journey, I've had the honor of attending the Grace Hopper Conference, achieving recognition on the Dean's List, and becoming a member of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon Honor Society. My coursework has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer science, covering topics such as Web App Development, Data Structures, and Object-Oriented Design. I've also undertaken challenging projects, including creating a Class Registration Bot using Python web scraping and developing an efficient 8 Puzzle solving program in Java. During my internship at Putnam Investments, I gained practical experience in cloud computing, deployment automation, and application modernization. Working with AWS CloudWatch, Kubernetes, and UI modernization projects, I actively contributed while engaging in mentorship programs and organizational activities. Beyond academics and work, I thrive in leadership roles. As a New Sailor Advisor for the Boston University Sailing Team and Treasurer of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, I've honed my communication, problem-solving, and financial management skills. With a diverse skill set spanning programming languages, cloud technologies, and leadership abilities, I'm ready to make meaningful contributions to any team or organization I join.</p>
