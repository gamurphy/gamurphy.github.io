                <p id="assignmentParagraph"> In this assignment I used google colab to test out all my code. It is very easy to debug and visualize data one colab and its something that I have used before which make it easy to approach this assignment </p>

                <p id="assignmentParagraph"> In this assignment I used google colab to first create/test/visualize all my backend code in python (aka the 4 types of centroid initlization methods & the rest of the kmeans algorithm). Then I built a React.js application which allowed me to use JavaScript as the frontend and connect it to my backend Python file which had to be slightly altered from the original python files I created. </p>

                <p id="assignmentParagraph"> In this assignment I used google colab to first create/test/visualize all my code in python. I followed along a SVD step by step process and recreated it in Python using some built in functions that were allowed like eig.</p>
